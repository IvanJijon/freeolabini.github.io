title: Ecuadorian justice accepts writ of habeas corpus in favor of Ola Bini
---
On the evening of Thursday June 20, the Ecuadorian court accepted the writ of habeas corpus granting the release of renowned Swedish free software and privacy advocate Ola Bini, detained since April 11, 2019 in Quito.

After hearing the news, Ola Bini responded, “I will like to thank the people of Ecuador. I want to thank everyone in the world, I want to thank my team, everyone for believing in me. Today, we have proven my innocence for the first time and we will continue to prove my innocence. I want to thank the judges for showing what we've been saying the whole time: this process has been illegal and that I was illegally detained. And I want to say my heartfelt thanks for all the support and love from my parents and my family, and everyone out there. Thank you everyone".

Defense lawyer Mario Melo noted “this demonstrates Bini's arrest violated all legal precept -- his detention was unlawful and arbitrary, as many human rights groups around the world have argued".

In response to the request for habeas corpus filed by Bini’s legal team, the court of the Provincial Court of Pichincha accepted the request of the defense in accordance with the provisions of article 89 of the Constitution of the Republic. This ends the more than 70 days in which Bini remained in the Provisional Detention Center (CDP) with no formal charge.

This decision will allow Bini to defend himself in freedom and to demonstrate to the Ecuadorian Government that he was not involved in any computer system violation as the authorities have claimed. Bini will remain in the country until he fully demonstrates his innocence.

On May 7, 2019, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention Team wrote to the Ecuador government, expressing concern over Bini’s detention. At last week’s RightsCon summit around human rights in the digital age, in Tunis on June 13th, UN and OAS Special Rapporteurs on Freedom of Expression, David Kaye and Edison Lanza, reiterated their grave concerns about Bini’s detention, noting they would be discussing Bini’s case at the upcoming Geneva Human Rights Council session.
