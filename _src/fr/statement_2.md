title: Free Ola Bini On-Going Persecution Statement
---
### Ola Bini's persecution is still ongoing.

After consultations that were recently held within the framework of the XII
Latin America and Caribbean Internet Governance Forum (LACIGF12), an
agglomeration of organizations that defend human rights in the digital realm,
(APC, Derechos Digitales, EFF, Internet Bolivia, Intervozes, and Karisma), have
drafted and signed a joint statement against the ongoing political persecution
of Ola Bini in Ecuador.

This latest alert has been confirmed now that the Ecuadorian state prosecutors
are attempting to initiate two new fields of query in the existing probe against
Ola Bini; the latest are for alleged “tax fraud” and for “influence peddling”.

This latest decision, is indicative that there is no evidence to sustain the
initial accusations that were made against Ola Bini (for alleged attacks on
computer systems,) as well as a manifest pursuit of an individual instead of an
actual crime.

We invite you and your organization to add your signature to the following statement.

#FreeOlaBini
