After almost a week in Ecuador, here are the findings of FEP in the case of
Swedish free software developer, Ola Bini, a security investigator arrested in
April. The consensus of the experts they spoke with was that an important factor
affecting the current state of the trial were the perceived political
consequences of abandoning the case or continuing prosecution. More information [here](https://www.eff.org/es/deeplinks/2019/08/ecuador-political-actors-must-step-away-ola-binis-case) (in Spanish).
