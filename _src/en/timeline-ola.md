### April 11 – 15.30:

Ola is detained at the 'Mariscal Sucre International Airport' in Quito, Ecuador, and is placed in an area for non-admitted persons. They say that he was being held under a temporary movement restriction order. He was in the queue to board the airplane when his detention happened. He is shown a restriction order that had another person's name first, and then another with another nationality (Swiss). He is held at the airport with no access to his lawyers, with no translation to his mother tongue, and, at no point, was he informed of the charges. They constantly try to make him sign a statement. This detention order is claimed to be justified by Article 444.8  of the Comprehensive Criminal Code, which states:

"it is the duty of the prosecutor 'to prevent, for a time not exceeding eight hours, that the persons whose information is necessary, are held absent from the place'".

"Let's investigate what the activity is, in which someone can be involved in, to warrant that kind of capacity. What it shows us is, that when a quarter of a million dollars was paid, for over four years for Internet, that it probably required a large access for download capacity.
The question is, --for what reasons, with what objectives",  Romo said."
