title: Free Ola Bini On-Going Persecution Statement
---
### Ola Bini's persecution is still ongoing.

After the conversations held during the XII Internet Governance Forum of
Latin America and the Caribbean, a group of organizations in defense of Human
Rights on the Internet (APC, Derechos Digitales, EFF, Internet Bolivia,
Intervozes and Karisma) have pronounced against the political persecution that
Ola Bini is suffering in Ecuador. This persecution has been confirmed as the
Prosecutor's Office is now attempting to initiate two new lines of investigation
against Ola: one for "tax fraud" and another for "influence peddling." This
decision shows that there is no evidence to support the initial accusations
made against the activist (violation of computer systems), and that justice and
the Ecuadorian's government are behind a person and not a crime. For this
reasons, we invite you to adhere your name to this statement.
