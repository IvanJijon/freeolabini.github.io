To the Honorable Ambassador of Ecuador in County X (Name)

Dear Honorable (Name),

My name is X  (your name or the name of the org). A quick introduction of who you are or to your organization, your relation if any, to the cause of digital privacy etc., or to Ola personally.
In the spirit of the noble concept that is anchored in the Ecuadorian Constitution of sumak kawsay;
„a society that respects, in all its dimensions, the dignity of individuals and community groups", and as is enshrined in Article 9, which ensures that „Foreign persons in Ecuadorian territory shall have the same rights and duties as those of Ecuadorians, in accordance with the Constitution", I/We am/are appealing to you today.

On April 11th, Ola Bini, the world-renowned Swedish privacy and open source advocate, was taken into custody at the Quito International Airport, for being accused of "conspiring against the state". As of yet, no formal charges have been made, and Ola continues to be in pretrial detention in deplorable conditions.

I/We am/are concerned that his basic Human Rights have been violated and that the Ecuadorian authorities aren't upholding their obligations as signatories to ratified treaties and international covenants as well as the UN's Mandela Rules, that ensure that detained persons are treated humanely, and are not subjected to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.

Ola Bini's work has been a benefit to Ecuadorian society. His work was legal, legitimate and beneficial to the national economy. He is being criminalized for the technology he possessed; his predilection for books in the English language, and for his choice of profession. He is a highly respected expert in his field, which he has ethically and honestly and transparently made his livelihood in as a resident of Ecuador for the last 6 years.

The many irregularities that have been documented by the Defense surrounding the arbitrary nature of his arrest are alarming. The Swedish Consulate, which ought to have been notified immediately upon Ola's detention, was not notified until 17 hours later; there was no valid warrant issued when Ola was intercepted at the airport; subsequently, the wrong warrant was served; one that had been issued for a Russian citizen, etc.. Bini was then held incommunicado for 18 hours before being able to consult a lawyer; his Miranda rights were not read to him; no translator was provided, etc.. These are but a few of the untenable legal irregularites in this case.

If there is indeed a case to be brought against Mr. Bini, then the Prosecution should present evidence of a crime as the basic rules of law dictate, If not, the presumption of innocence must prevail and he should be released from preventive prison immediately.

Respectfully,
